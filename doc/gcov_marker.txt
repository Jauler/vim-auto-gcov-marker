                                                *gcov-marker-introduction*
Introduction ~

This plugin provides a simple way to build and load gcov files for an open
source file. It will highlight the covered and uncovered lines and branchs.

It does not show you detailed information about the coverage at the moment so
you do not get detailed information like the number of hits.

let g:gcov_marker_line_uncovered = '✘'
let g:gcov_marker_branch_covered = '✓✓'
let g:gcov_marker_branch_partly_covered = '✓✘'
let g:gcov_marker_branch_uncovered = '✘✘'


Also *GcovBuild* command searches recursively for gcna files in
directory prefixed by g:gcov_gcno_path variable.

let g:gcov_gcno_path = 'path/to/gcno/files/'


The *GcovBuild* command needs to know where to put the ".gcov" files. The
variable takes a comma seperated list of folders.

let g:gcov_marker_path  = 'path/to/gcov/files/'
